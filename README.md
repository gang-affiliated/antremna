# here's some bars

throw a dime in it you gon see im really with it
fill your spine with some led rockin' true religion
carry sticks all the time like its huntin' season
straight gang since a JID never had a reason
"Banging streets never paid" thats all cap im hearing
throw a shade catch a fade that's what bitches gettin'
hold up wait let me switch up the flow a little
got my name on my own so i know a little
making money off these beats nah that's hobby
gettin' rich with my bros that's all about it
if you dead and you fat ion' want no sloppy
only 10's on my dick yeah ion' want it

ion' want it if she ain't bad
find the one one day hope I ring that
till then imma always pull-up plus ten
couple baddies and my fam bitch I rock vans

with my glockieee
got some 44's but I rather have them locked in
that's for when I pop-off bitch
you don't want that trust meee
no feelings they just killin' for a hobbyyyy
these younglings are fiends im sorryyyy
lord im sorryyyy
